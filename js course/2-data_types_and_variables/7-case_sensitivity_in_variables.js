// variable names and function names in JS are case sensitive. 
// that means that capitalization matters. 
// let's see declaration that is not the same as the assignment. 

// declarations
var StUdLyCapVaR; 

// Assignment
STUDELYCAPVAR = 10; 

// Usually in js we are using camelcase. 

var studlyCapVar; // so the first latter is always going to be lowercase. any time you have a new word you just capitalize the first letter. 
studlyCapVar = 10; //now it's not going to give us any error.
