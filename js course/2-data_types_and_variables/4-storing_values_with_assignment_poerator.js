// there is a difference betwen declaring variable and assigning variables. 


// declare a variable:
var a; 

// we are declaring and asign a variable in one line. the equal sign is the assignment operator. 
// in means that 2 is being assigned to b. we are not cheching if b equal to 2 we're just assinging 2 to b. 
var b = 2;
console.log(a)

//let's assign a number to a that have been already declared. 
a = 7; 

// we can also say that b = a. so now we assign the content of a to b.  
b = a


// console.log allows you to see things in the console.
// let's check a. 
console.log(a)


// to run the code go to terminal, file path, type node + file name
