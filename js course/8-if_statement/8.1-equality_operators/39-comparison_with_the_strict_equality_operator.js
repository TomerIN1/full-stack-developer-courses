// we learnd about the quality operator which is the double equal == sign. 
// there's also the strict equality operator, the triple equal sign ===. 
// the double quals sign attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, 
// while the stict equality operator does not do the type conversation. 


// 3 === 3 --> here we're checking if 3 equals 3 with the strict equality operator. this is going to evalueate to True. 
// 3 === '3' --> but here with this string '3' it is going to evaluate to false. 
// BOTH! of these whould be true if we were using the double equals sign ==. because, the string will be converted to a number and it whould be equal to true.
