// adding two numbers in JS is pretty straight forward. 
var sum = 10 + 10; // use the plose operator. 

// check in console
console.log(sum);

// more operators
var subtract = 10 - 2.5 
var multiple = 10 * 2
var devide = 10 / 2

//decimal / floting numbers / floats. 
//we can use decimal numbers in js. also called floting numbers or floats. 
var ourDecimal = 5.00007; 

//multiply decimals
var product = 2.0 * 2.5; 
console.log(product)

//device decimals
var quotient = 4.4 / 2.0; 
console.log(quotient);


//---------------------------------------------------------------------------//
//dinding a remainder - remainder of a devision of two numbers// 
var remainder; 
remainder = 11 % 3; // 11 devided by 3 is 9. 11 minus 9 is 2. so the remainder is going to be 2. 
console.log(remainder)

// the remainder is also helps to detect odd or even numbers. 
// if you can divide a number by 2 and the remainder is 0 that means the number is even.
