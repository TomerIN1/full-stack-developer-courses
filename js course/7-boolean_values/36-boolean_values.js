//booleans are another datatype in js. 
// there are only two values, true or false. 
// they're basically little on/off switches where true is on and false is off. 
// they don't use quotation markes around the Boolean. 

function welcomeToBooleans(){
    return true;
}

function welcomeToBooleans2(){
    return false;
}

// you can use tru and false in more places that just function returns.
