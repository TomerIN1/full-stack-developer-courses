// objects! objects are similar to arrays. 
// except that insead of using indexes to access data, you use properties. 

// example
var ourDog = { //objects defined with these curly craces at the beginning and the end. 
    "name": "Bisli", //the properties are everything before the colons. in this line the property is "name".  
    "legs": 4, // and then the values are the things after the colons. each property has it's own value. 
    "tails": 1,  // you can see the values can be strings, values and verious data types. 
    "friends": ['everything!']
};
